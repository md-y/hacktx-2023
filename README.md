# Welcome to **AmIBroke.tech**
---
## Inspiration
There are no readily-available applications that provide a simple, accessible computation of one's net worth. Largely out of pure curiosity, we wanted to build an app that calculated a user's equity, allowing for the easy compounding, customization, and general management of assets and liabilities, for accessible and immediate access to personal financial health.

## What it does
Our app, AmIBroke.tech, allows our users to calculate their liquid net worths in their entirety. We have provided an interface that enables our users to input their tangible and intangible assets, as well as any and all liabilities, utilizing the data to showcase our users' most current net worth in an accessible, appealing format, while also predicting a long-term asset's future rate of depreciation or appreciation.

## How we built it
We built the front-end using a static SvelteKit website that is built automatically with Github actions. The website itself is hosted with Github pages; the back-end is hosted with Google Cloud Run; and authentication, as well as our database, are powered by Firebase. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had significant trouble setting up CORS with our back end server, and getting our add asset overlay to work properly.

## What we learned


## What's next for AmIBroke.tech
We're looking forward to expanding on the accuracy of our assets; specifically, showcasing our users' market liquidity, and perhaps their personal accounting liquidity. In the name of improved accessibility and understanding of personal finances for anyone willing to download AmIBroke.tech, we also hope to provide some resources on increasing one's liquidity, and enhancing their personal finance management capabilities as a whole.
