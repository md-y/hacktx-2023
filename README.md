## Inspiration
There are no readily-available applications that provide a simple, accessible computation of one's net worth. Largely out of pure curiosity, we wanted to build an app that calculated a user's equity, allowing for the easy culmination, management, and customization of assets and liabilities.

## What it does
Our app, AmIBroke.tech, allows our users to calculate their liquid net worths in their entirety. We have provided an interface that enables our users to input their tangible and intangible assets, as well as any and all liabilities, and showcases our users' net worth in an accessible, appealing format.
Users are given avenue to manage and track their finances
